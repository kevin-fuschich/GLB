Global League Baseball (GLB)
Canon & Operations

1. What GLB Is
Global League Baseball (GLB) is a fictional professional baseball league that runs continuously.
Games are simulated daily. Box scores, standings, and league leaders are updated automatically. The season progresses without interruption, results accumulate, and history is recorded as it happens.
GLB exists as a living record—scores, results, and statistics—presented in the same format and tone as a real baseball league. There are no gimmicks, no fantasy mechanics, and no required participation.
GLB is part of the broader Hump City universe, where ideas are allowed to exist simply because they are interesting.
